This repository contains a small collection of Python utilities designed to simplify routine file processing tasks that often arise when working with notebooks, scripts, and datasets. The scripts address common practical issues such as incorrect encodings, GitHub rendering problems for Colab notebooks, and unnecessary embedded images in converted files.

## `notebook_fix.py`

This script cleans Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files downloaded from Google Colab by removing problematic metadata that prevents notebooks from being displayed correctly on GitHub. It is a fork of another [project](https://gist.github.com/drscotthawley/e6927f1389f262ecbabfe41d31989e1c) and intends to fix a common [issue](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/155944).

## `remove_images.py`

This utility removes embedded images from `.py` files that were generated by converting notebooks using Google Colab tools. Such files often contain large base64-encoded image blocks that are irrelevant if only the code or text is needed. The script strips these image lines in place, reducing file size and making the output easier to process or version-control.

## `get_file_encoding.py`

This script detects the character encoding of a given file using the `chardet` library. It is especially helpful when working with data files such as CSVs that may use non-UTF-8 encodings and cause decoding errors in tools like pandas. The script reads the raw bytes and reports the most likely encoding. To use the script, install the `chardet` library.

## `print_all_files.py`

A simple utility script that recursively traverses a directory tree and prints the contents of every file. For each file, its path is printed first, followed by the full file content line by line, making it convenient for exporting the textual state of a project.
